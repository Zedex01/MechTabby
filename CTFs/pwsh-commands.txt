Using powershell for solving CTFs requires a different set of commands.

to read a file as a hex format: 
	Format-Hex -Path "C:\path\to\your\file.ext"


.PNG files have the same structre every time.

PNG header is always 8 Bytes:
	89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A

Following this it is all chunks. Each chunk is made of 4 parts:

	Length (4 Bytes) 00 00 00 00
	Type/NAME {IHDR/IDAT} (4 Bytes) 00 00 00 00 
	Data (Length Bytes) 
	CHecksum (4 Bytes) 00 00 00 00

	
	Common PNG Chunks:
		IHDR - Image Header 49 48 44 52
		PLTE - Palette
		IDAT - Image Data
		tEXt / iTXt / zTXt - Optional Hidden or metadata
		Other


RED:
	IHDR is 13 Bytes
	 


	exiftool exposes the POEM inside the png. 
	Reading the poem you can see each line is capitilized and only showing capitalized letters gives us: CHECKLSB

	LSB or least signifigant bit (far right most bit) is common practice for stenogrephy of png images.
