Steganography


Shit is wild.

Essentially, every pixel in an image is made of rgba values represented in binary.

So for example, a single purple pixel can be represented in base 10 as:
	
	rgba: 244, 3, 252, 255

and converted to binary, base 2:
	
	[11110100, 00000011, 11111100, 11111111]

using this representation, messages can be encoded by replacing the lsb of the rgb channels (not aplha) one pixel at a time. this is done by grabbing the binary representation of the message that you want to encode. inserting one bit into each pixel in order r, g, b, r, g, b
