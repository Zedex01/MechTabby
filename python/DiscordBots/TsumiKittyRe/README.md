# Tsumikitty
Tsumikitty is a discord bot framework designed specifically for managing minecraft servers hosted on you local computer.

This was initailly designed since the inability to have a static ip from my isp made it difficult for anyone joining the server.

This bot allows for anyone within the discord server to remotly garb the IP of the server (Your device), and other various things.

This project is a work in progress and is being updated.

WARNING: This is inheriently not safe, ensure that the only people who have access to your bot / discord server
 are people you trust since they have direct access to your local network.
