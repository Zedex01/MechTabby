Workflow is: A. Define the project in CMakeLists.txt.  B.Run CMake to create the Makefile. C. Build your project using Make



when building:

cd into build, 
	run cmake ..

this create the makefiles inside of build.
then, run make:
	this creates the exe also in build


** Depending on PC setup, may need to specify file type. For example:

can create .sln by defualt is you have visual studio. 

to get make files:

	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
